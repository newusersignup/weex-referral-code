<h2>What is a WEEX Referral Code?</h2>
<p>A <strong>WEEX referral code</strong> — also called a <strong>WEEX invitation code</strong> or <strong>WEEX promo code</strong> — is a unique alphanumeric string shared by existing users or affiliates.

Essentially, it’s a way for WEEX to reward users who bring in new traders and for newcomers to start with advantages that improve their trading experience.</p>
<p>For example, if you use the <strong>TOPTOP</strong> WEEX referral code when creating your account, you automatically qualify for a <strong>WEEX signup bonus</strong> and <strong>WEEX referral bonus</strong>, which often include fee discounts and trading credits. These offers are updated regularly to give users the best possible start in the fast-evolving crypto market.</p>
